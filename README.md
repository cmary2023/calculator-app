## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **HTML** defines the calculator layout and buttons.
2. **CSS Grid** arranges buttons into a clean, responsive layout.
3. **JavaScript**:
   - Stores the first number, operator, and second number.
   - Calculates result when an operator or `=` is pressed.
   - Updates display after each action.
   - Prevents multiple decimals in one number.
   - Handles keyboard events for faster input.
